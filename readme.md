# STM32F4-HD44780 #

Interrupt driven software for the ST Microelectronics STMF4 Cortex-M4 microcontroller to interface with a Hitachi-compatible HD44780 LCD module.  Works in 4bit mode using 7 pins and is 5v compatible, tested on a STM32F4 Discovery with a variety of LCD modules.

Minor modifications applied to allow RS,RW and E pins on different GPIO to data and sample code in main() changed to enable level shift in my implementation -  Sam Nicholson (sam [at] samn.co.uk)

##Usage##

Complete documentation can be found here.

A brief example is included in the source code.

Initialise the driver using:

`hd44780_init(gpio_data, gpio_cfg, rs, rw, e, db4, db5, db6, db7, lines, font)`

where:

`gpio_data, gpio_cfg` - GPIO Ports for config and data pins (GPIOA to GPIOE)

`rs, rw, e, db4, db5, db6, db7` - Pins (`GPIO_Pin_0` to `GPIO_Pin_15`)

`lines` - LCD lines (`HD44780_LINES_1` or `HD44780_LINES_2`)

`font`- Font size (`HD44780_FONT_5x8` or `HD44780_FONT_5x10`)
